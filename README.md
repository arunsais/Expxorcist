===========================================
List of directories:

1) algorithm/ : contains the main code for learning expxorcist
2) baselines/ : code for baselines (GGM, Nonparanormal)
3) data/ : contains the scripts to generate the simulation data used in the experiments. also has part of the simulation data.
4) stats/ : contains helper scripts to compute ROC stats.
